system_error_&H80004005

software name	:
			visual basic 6.0
host os		:
			windows 2000 professional
running os	:
			windows xp sp3
description	:	
			"vb6.exe", "api text viewer.exe", as well as many other ActiveX(or COM) related programs just displayed
			"System Error &H80004005 (-2147467259)" , then teminated itself or by OS.
solution	:
			The problem may be caused by one of the "Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise" components, "Application 
			Performance Explorer" in catagory "Enterprise Tools"¡£It works fine, if VB6 installed without service
			packs, when the service packs (either 5 or 6) are applied, the error would likely to occur.
